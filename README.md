# Unexpected Behavior with Arbitrary Values in Style Attribute Using Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using arbitrary values (like `width: 700px;`) within the `style` attribute of HTML elements alongside Tailwind CSS.

## Problem
Sometimes, directly specifying styles like `width: 700px;` can conflict with Tailwind's utility classes or cause unpredictable results.  Debugging this can be tricky because the issue might only manifest in specific circumstances or browser environments.

## Solution
The best practice is to always prefer Tailwind's utility classes whenever possible.  If a specific pixel value is absolutely necessary, consider using a responsive design approach with Tailwind's breakpoints and media queries or a custom CSS file for such edge cases, preventing conflicts.
